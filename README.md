# go-benchmarks
A little personal playground for benchmarking whatever I'm curious about as I learn Go

There's not a lot going on here. It's just me playing with the benchmark functionality built into Go's `testing` package.

## Running

From the root directory of this project, run

```
go test -bench=.
```
